* Changes: README.md, test.ipynb. Begin extracting labelled data. 

**Label Keys**:
* **TODO**: Include a spectrogram sample for each type of call.
* **NOTE**: *boom* and *coda* calls are not labelled. 
* sc: staccato 
* mm: multi-modulated
* coda: Special type of *mm* call which the male only makes in response to the female great call
* gc: great call. These are made by female gibbons. Immatures may also join in but will be quieter than the adult female(s). It consists of a series of very rapid calls that build in frequency and loudness. The male coda call comes in at the end.
